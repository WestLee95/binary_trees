This repo contains a new data structure called Binary Trees.
It handles various scenarios as the assignment had stated.
In general, this was learned from this exercise:
       > What is a binary tree
       > What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
       > What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
       > What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
       > What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
       > What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
The following code was also compiled using this command:
             Example;   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 11-binary_tree_size.c 11-main.c
                0-binary_tree_node.c 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c -o 11-size
